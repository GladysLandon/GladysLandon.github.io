                <p>Strength was added to this page by adding white space. Elements use color to call
                    attention toward focal points. The first element the user sees is
                    the image of Billy and his dog, Monster. He is homeless and well known about town.
                    Homelessness and building community are the focus of this organization. This is easily
                    navigated by order of importance. The Cold Weather Shelter brings together the community.

                <p>The Visual Hierarch Principle pushes the user to their main focus. In the case of downeast basics
                    that
                    focus is getting emails to advertise their product. The subscribe pop-up shows before an opportunity
                    to shop.

                <p>On this site black is used as an emotional connection to Martin Luther King. It's clean and
                    straight to the point. On a wider screen the picture of Martin King is viewed
                    on the same page. I found it interesting to note the words show first on a smaller
                    screen. The words are the message apple.com wants to push.
