<h1>Lesson 2:: Design Principles Document</h1>
<h2>Proximity Principle</h2>
<img src="img_w2/srhpg.png" alt="sierraroots.org homepage">
<p>Strength was added to this page by adding white space.  Elements use color to call
    attention toward focal points.  The first element the user sees is 
    the image of Billy and his dog, Monster.  He is homeless and well known about town.
    Homelessness and building community are the focus of this organization.  This is easily 
    navigated by order of importance.  The Cold Weather Shelter brings together the community.
</p>
<h2>Visual Hierarchy Principle</h2>
<img src="img_w2/dwnhpg.png" alt="downeastbasics.com homepage">
<p>The Visual Hierarch Principle pushes the user to their main focus.  In the case of downeast basics that 
    focus is getting emails to advertise their product.  The subscribe pop-up shows before an opportunity
    to shop.
</p>
<h2>White Space & Clean Design Principle</h2>
<img src="img_w2/applehpg.png" alt="apple.com homepage Martin Luther King Day">
<p>On this site black is used as an emotional connection to Martin Luther King.  It's clean and 
    straight to the point.  On a wider screen the picture of Martin King is viewed 
    on the same page.  I found it interesting to note the words show first on a smaller
    screen.  The words are the message apple.com wants to push.
